<h1>The Best Movies According to Kelly</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of a spotless mind</h3>
<p>A thought provocating representation of heartbreak and mental illness. I love the way the shots have blurred the lines between memories and reality.</p>
<h3>Kevin and Perry Go Large</h3>
<p>A cheesy, funny over the top teenage movie from the 90's featuring an amazing soundtrack and the jokes are totally lame! An easy watch time after time.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>An amazing big budget space flick, I loved the twists and turns and again an amazing soundtrack.</p>
